# Basic Assumption
## Component partitioning and component combination assumptions
*  The control board can be seen as two components: “Control Hard Unit” corresponds to the hardware circuit part, and “Control Software Component” corresponds to the software program part.
*  Before using measure 2, the interface board can be regarded as an “interface component” consisting of 21 statistically independent components, and is applicable to series combination; after using measure 2, the interface board can be regarded as 29 statistically independent components. The "interface components" are constructed and applied in tandem.
*  A hub can be thought of as a “hub component” consisting of 19 statistically distinct components and is suitable for series combination.
* Based on the above assumptions, the simulation model after the system has not taken measures 2 and taken measures 2 is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

## Variable distribution
* Formulas huge, take a picture show
