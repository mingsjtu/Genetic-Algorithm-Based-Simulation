# Genetic-Algorithm-Based-Simulation
The file is written in MATLAB , and full code has be tested successfully on MATLAB 2016b.
## Problem Background

This test studies the reliability of a RS485 multi-machine communication system by mathematical 
modeling. The main steps are: assuming the service life, fault types, and solutions of the electronic 
components that make up the system. Then we do algorithm research and simulation experiments using 
Monte Carlo method, and finally get the important parameters such as the number of repairs, the 
trouble-free running time, and the no major fault running time. We wish to provide the best solution for 
the design of the system, and give reasonable suggestions for the improvement of the system.
